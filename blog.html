							Have you ever wandered, who was the first scientist of the world?
							To find a meaningful answer to this question, one needs to carefully conduct an investigation.
							And the investigation should start with asking the ultimate question; "who is a scientst?".
							In a sense, can one accept early homo sapiens who invented using tools, making use of fire etc. as scientists?
							Or does the essence of science lies within the concept of conformity: Can one became a scientist without satisfying their other earthly needs?
							Seneca suggested that in order to continue 'thinking' one must conform their earthly needs; i.e. one must be rich enough to 'think'.
							Today we all know that Seneca was <i>filthy</i> rich and spent his life in confort.
							So, what is the key difference between a scientist and an inventor?
							Who is the first inventor and/or scientist?
							When did homo sapiens decided to value science, or did they ever?
